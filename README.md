# Automating-Splunk-with-n8n

## Overview 
This project is an end-to-end SOC automation pipeline that demonstrates how modern security operations team automate triage, enrichment, and notification workflow using:

- Splunk (Detection)
- N8N (Orchestration)
- OpenAI (AI assisted triage)
- Slack (Alert delivery to analysts)

## Project Goal

**Build a fully automated workflow that:**

1. Detects security events in Splunk
2. Sends alerts to N8N through a webhook
3. Automatically triggers AI-powered triage using OpenAI
4. Enriches IOCs (IP / Hash) using AbuseIPDB & Virustotal
5. Sends a structured triage to a Slack channel which analysts can view

## Outcome

By completing this Proof of Concept, we demonstrate how SOC automation can:

- Reduce analyst time spent on repetitive enrichment
- Deliver consistent, structured triage reports
- Deliver alerts to Slack and instantly alert analysts

| Component / Role             | Description                          | IP Address      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| **Windows 10 Endpoint**      | Target machine sending Sysmon logs   | `192.168.1.100` |

## Setup and Configuration 

### Splunk

**What is it?**
Splunk is a Security Information Events Manager (SIEM) used to collect and index logs multiple devices (firewalls, Endpoints, Routers, etc) to enable search, correlation and monitoring all on a single interface. 

**Use Case:**
In this project we will set up an alert for Event ID 4625. Splunk will then forward this alert to N8N via a webhook which will then be forwarded to additional nodes. 

**Configuration:**

- Installed Splunk enterprise on a machine with the static IP of **192.168.1.9** on Ubuntu 24.04.2 live server (*Figure 1*).
- Installed Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Windows
- Splunk Universal Forwarder was setup for the **Windows 10 Endpoint**
- Forwarders were configured to send logs to Splunk via tcp port 9997 to the Splunk Server (*Figure 2*).
- Created a Search Query to look for failed logon attempts and saved it as an alert (*Figure 3*)
- Configured the Alert to work as a webhook and forward this over to N8N (*Figure 4*)

### Windows 10 Endpoint

**What is it:**

The windows 10 machine served as domain-joined endpoint and is used for generating user activity, authentication logs, and endpoint telemetry for monitoring and detection 

**Use Case:**
A Windows 10 Endpoint was configured within the LAN to able to forward logs (including failed authentication attempts) over to our spunk server. This machine was also used to access the N8N UI for configuring workflow nodes and setup the slack channele for recieving alerts generated by OpenAI.

**Configuration:**

- Configured with a static IP address of 192.168.1.100
- Joined the domain sam-ad.local
- Installed Splunk Universal Forwarder
  - Configured forwarder to send Windows Security and Sysmon logs to the Splunk Indexer (192.168.1.9) via TCP port 9997
- Configured the "inputs.conf" file to specify which logs to forward and which index to send them to (*Figure 5*)

### N8N 

**What is it?**
N8N is an open-source workflow automation platform designed to connect applications, services, and data sources to automate repetitive tasks. 

**Use Case:**
In this project N8N is used (using bUbuntu Live Server) to automate the process of repetive tasks with analysing alerts created by splunk and perform enrichment with IP Addresses and Hashes using IPDBAbuse and VirusTotal. 

**Configuration**
- Installed Docker & Docker-compose
- Created docker-compose.yml to install the latest version if N8N(*Figure 6*)
- Deployed N8N
- Configured Webhook to recieve alerts from splunk (*Figure 7*)
- Build Automation Workflow (*Figure 8*)

### N8N Open AI Configuration 

#### **Overview:**

This section covers the workflow, more specifically the OpenAI's Message a Model Node to to automatically analyse incoming Splunk Alert. The goal is to replicate the actions of a tier 1 SOC analyst by summarising the alert, enriching indicators, mapping MITRE ATT&CK techniques, and generating recommended next steps. 

**Prompt Engineering

to ensure consistent and structured output, multiple propmts were configured

1. **Assistent Prompt**

This prompt instructs the LLM to behave like a Tier 1 SOC Analyst. It performs:
- Alert Summarisation
- IOC Enrichment (IP or File Hash)
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Recommended Actions
- It also specifies which tools the model should use (AbuseIPDB for IPs, and VirusTotal fir Hashes)

2. **User Prompt**

This prompt controls Splunks data being passed into the LLM (*Figure 9*)

3. **System Prompt**

This Prompt controls the formating ensuring OpenAI returns structured triage report, using the following format (*Figure 10*):
- Summary
- IOC Enrichment
- Severity Assesment
- Recommended Actions

### Tooling Intergration 

Our Open AI node uses two additional enrichment tools which include:
- AbuseIPDB Lookup Tool - This is used to enrich and score external IP Addresses uby querying the AbuseIPDB API for reputation scores and threat classification. 
- VirusTotal Hash Lookup Tool - This is used to analyse any suspicious file hashes found in the alert
  - These tools are directly refferenced in the Assistant Prompt so it knows when to use it.
    - Though we won't find Hashes in failed Logons we can hardcode a file hash as a proof of concept to demonstrate that OpenAI can automatically query VirusTotal using its API and Generate a report on this.
